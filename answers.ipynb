The lengths and widths are measured in centimetres. Suppose we want to create the following transformations:\n",
    "- For the first feature (sepal lenght in cm) we want to transform it to inches (1 inch = 2,54 cm).\n",
    "- For the second feature (sepal width in cm) we want to transform it to a range in between 0 and 1.\n",
    "- For the third feature (petal length in cm) we want to transform it to a boolean expression indicating whether or not it is larger than the mean. (1 if larger than mean, and 0 otherwise). \n",

When the determinant of a matrix is equal to zero, then the inverse has to give you an error message. Can you try to understand this error message? and after that fix the matrix such that the inverse exists. Hint: there is a simplified formula to calculate the determinant of a 2 by 2 matrix and using this formula you can easily choose the numbers in the matrix."
